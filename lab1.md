# ​​Lab 1: Unix and Python programming
In the Python assignments you are expected to use Python and no additional libraries. The goal is to practice writing "pure" Python for those occasions when libraries or other good tools are not available for one reason or another. Assignment 1 can be completed after the first lecture and 2-3 after the Video Lecture 1, 4-6 after Video Lecture 2, 7-9 after Video Lecture 3.

To help you get organized the assignment (not related to a Video Lecture)​ should be solved by adding code to the following code skeleton: lab1.py​

## Assignments

1. Unix introduction
2. Data type: strings​ (Video Lecture 1, string_exercise.py)
3. Random DNA sequences ​​
4. Real DNA sequences​ ​ 
5. Data type: lists  (Video Lecture 2, list_exercise.py)
6. DNA, RNA or Protein
7. Re-formatting sequences​
8. Data type: dictionaries​ (Video Lecture 3, organismcount.py)
9. Translate DNA
